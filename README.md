# Video Transcoder 2

This is the .NET version of the [original transcoder project](https://github.com/faburaya/videotranscoder).
It offers less options to configure the CODEC, but it still enables fast trancoding via hardware acceleration.
(For hardware acceleration to work you need proper support from you graphic card drivers.)
